I have a list of cars that I need generated as separate images.

For each individual car in the list below, please generate a separate image using this specific prompt template:

'A clean, high-resolution 32-bit pixel art sprite of a [Insert Car Name]. The vehicle is shown in a strictly flat 2D orthographic side profile view with zero perspective, facing left, with the hood on the left side of the image. The framing is close-up to maximize the size and pixel detail of the car within the canvas. High-detail pixel shading, rich color palette appropriate for the car, isolated on a solid plain grey background.'

Please generate the images one by one for the following vehicles:

Fictional Rusty Sedan
Fictional Muscle Car
Fictional Boxy Wagon
1969 Dodge Charger
1994 Toyota Supra
